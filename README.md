🚀 VdoCipher Aegis Bypass (Frida)
🔍 Frida-based runtime script for analyzing VdoCipher Aegis protections on Android.
🧠 What is this?
This project demonstrates how VdoCipher evaluates device security at runtime by inspecting:
📱 Rooted environments
🧪 Emulators
🛠️ Debug / Instrumentation (Frida)
⚙️ Java & Native (libvdomain.so) checks
The script interacts with internal analytics logic to observe how security signals are aggregated.
🧩 What it targets
🧬 Java layer (AppAnalytics)
🧱 Native layer (libvdomain.so)
🔁 Java ↔ Native decision flow
🎯 Purpose
🔬 Security research
📚 Reverse engineering learning
🧠 Understanding Android protection design
