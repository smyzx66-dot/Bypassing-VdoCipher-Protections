​🛡️ VdoCipher Aegis: The Ultimate Integrity Bypass
​A sophisticated Frida-based instrumentation script designed to neutralize VdoCipher Aegis protection layers. It performs deep-level hooking on both Java (DEX) and Native (JNI) layers to ensure a "Clean Device" state.
​✨ Key Features
​⚡ Bitmask Neutralization: Overrides the centralized threat scoring system to return a zeroed (Safe) state.  
​📂 Filesystem Cloaking: Intercepts mount point scanning and File.exists() calls to hide root traces.  
​🛠️ JNI Bridge Hooking: Directly targets exported symbols in libvdomain.so to manipulate native return values.  
​🛰️ Environment Spoofing: Forces system properties like ro.build.tags to report as official release-keys.  
​🛡️ Anti-Debug Bypass: Implements ptrace replacement to prevent the application from detecting the instrumentation engine.  
​🚀 Technical Architecture
​The script operates through a multi-tier interception strategy:
​Java Layer: Neutralizes com.vdocipher.aegis.analytics.internal.AppAnalytics methods.  
​Native Layer: Hooks internal logic for root, emulator, and debugger detection within the .so library.  
​Runtime Layer: Monitors Runtime.exec to prevent unauthorized shell integrity checks.
